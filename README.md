# medical_Tableau_anaylsis
A detailed medical device data analysis project using Excel for cleaning and Tableau for interactive visualization.
Project Overview (نظرة عامة على المشروع)

This project provides a detailed analysis of medical equipment maintenance data to identify cost drivers, failure patterns, and areas for strategic intervention. The analysis leverages a dataset covering several years of maintenance records, device specifications, and geographical locations.

*Tools:* Tableau (Visualization), Excel/CSV (Data Cleaning and Preparation).

## 🎯 Purpose of the Analysis (أهداف التحليل)

The main goal of this analysis is to answer key business questions regarding equipment performance:

* Identify total maintenance costs and failure counts over the years.
* Determine the relationship between device age and maintenance requirements.
* Analyze the impact of device type, model, manufacturer, and country on overall maintenance performance.

## 🔑 Key Findings and Insights (الرؤى والنتائج الرئيسية)

The analysis highlighted several critical areas:

### A. Performance Over Time and Device Age

* *Cost Peak:* The year *2018* recorded the highest maintenance cost and failure count.
* *Device Age Risk:* Maintenance cost increases significantly with device age, reaching its peak between *6 and 9 years*. (New equipment, age 1, predictably has very low costs).
* *Downtime:* Complex failures, though less frequent, consume the *most downtime* to repair (High maintenance class tasks take an average of 16 hours).

### B. Equipment and Manufacturer Focus

* *High-Cost Devices:* *X-Ray Machines, Defibrillators, and PET Scanners* are the most expensive devices to maintain.
* *Costly Models:* Models *500, 350, and 150* showed the highest maintenance costs.
* *Manufacturers:* *ScanPro, ImaginTech, and RescueTech* lead in total maintenance costs. *ScanPro, Medeqube, and ImaginTech* have the highest failure counts.

### C. Geographical Impact

* *Japan* has the highest total maintenance cost among all countries analyzed.

## 💡 Recommendations (التوصيات)

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

1.  *Preventive Maintenance Priority:* Prioritize maintenance efforts for devices *aged 6 to 9 years*, as they show the highest cost and downtime risk.
2.  *Strategic Review:* Focus on high-cost years (*2018–2019*) to investigate the root causes of increased expenses and failures.
3.  *Supplier Collaboration:* Collaborate with high-failure manufacturers like *ScanPro* and *ImaginTec* to identify and resolve design or quality issues.
4.  *Resource Allocation:* Allocate more maintenance resources to *complex repair tasks (high maintenance class)* to effectively reduce overall downtime.
5.  *Geographical Focus:* Review maintenance performance and supplier management in *Japan* due to its leading total cost.
6.  *Data-Driven Planning:* Implement data-driven maintenance planning using interactive dashboards to continuously monitor performance trends.
